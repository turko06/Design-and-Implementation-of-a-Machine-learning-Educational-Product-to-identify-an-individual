# Machine Learning-Based Identification System

## Introduction

### Overview of Security & Identification Methods
Security plays a crucial role in modern society, ensuring the safety of individuals and assets. Traditional identification methods include passwords, PINs, and biometric systems such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans. While effective, these conventional approaches have limitations in terms of security risks, privacy concerns, and accessibility.

### Multiple-Choice Questions
**What is a common limitation of traditional identification methods?**

<form>
  <input type="radio" name="q1" value="A"> A) They are too advanced for public use<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q1" value="B"> B) They pose security risks and privacy concerns <br>
  <input type="radio" name="q1" value="C"> C) They do not require authentication<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q1" value="D"> D) They are exclusively used in government systems<br>
  <button type="button" onclick="checkAnswer('q1', 'B')">Submit</button>

### Importance of Machine Learning in Security
Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized security systems by allowing automated pattern recognition and real-time decision-making. ML models can analyze unique behavioral and physiological traits, providing a more secure and adaptive method of identification.

### Multiple-Choice Questions
**How does machine learning enhance security systems?**

<form>
  <input type="radio" name="q2" value="A"> A) By replacing all human security personnel<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q2" value="B"> B) By analyzing unique behavioral and physiological traits <br>
  <input type="radio" name="q2" value="C"> C) By requiring more passwords<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q2" value="D"> D) By increasing reliance on traditional identification methods<br>
  <button type="button" onclick="checkAnswer('q2', 'B')">Submit</button>

## Background & Research

### Conventional vs. Non-Conventional Identification Methods
Traditional identification methods rely on fixed patterns such as biometrics, passwords, or ID cards. However, non-conventional approaches utilize less commonly explored physiological and behavioral characteristics, such as:

- Gait recognition (walking patterns)
- Heartbeat patterns
- Keystroke dynamics (typing rhythm)
- Motion sensor data

### Multiple-Choice Questions
**Which of the following is considered a non-conventional identification method?**

<form>
  <input type="radio" name="q3" value="A"> A) Passwords<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q3" value="B"> B) Fingerprint recognition<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q3" value="C"> C) Gait recognition <br>
  <input type="radio" name="q3" value="D"> D) ID cards<br>
  <button type="button" onclick="checkAnswer('q3', 'C')">Submit</button>
  <p id="q3-result"></p>
</form>

<script>
function checkAnswer(question, correctAnswer) {
    const options = document.getElementsByName(question);
    let selectedAnswer = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {
        if (options[i].checked) {
            selectedAnswer = options[i].value;
        }
    }
    const resultElement = document.getElementById(question + "-result");
    if (selectedAnswer === correctAnswer) {
        resultElement.innerHTML = " Correct!";
        resultElement.style.color = "green";
    } else {
        resultElement.innerHTML = "❌ Incorrect. Try again.";
        resultElement.style.color = "red";
    }
}
</script>
