## Accessibility and Navigation

There are several methods for navigating through the chapters (i.e., sessions).

The **sidebar** on the left provides a list of all chapters/sessions.
Clicking on any of the chapter/session titles will load that page.

The sidebar may not automatically appear if the window is too narrow, particularly on mobile displays.
In that situation, the menu icon (<i class="fa fa-bars"></i>) at the top-left of the page can be pressed to open and close the sidebar.

The **arrow buttons** at the bottom of the page can be used to navigate to the previous or the next chapter.

The **left and right arrow keys** on the keyboard can be used to navigate to the previous or the next chapter.

### Top menu bar

The menu bar at the top of the page provides some icons for interacting with the book.
The icons displayed will depend on the settings of how the book was generated.

| Icon | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> | Opens and closes the chapter listing sidebar. |
| <i class="fa fa-paint-brush"></i> | Opens a picker to choose a different color theme. |
| <i class="fa fa-search"></i> | Opens a search bar for searching within the book. |
| <i class="fa fa-print"></i> | Instructs the web browser to print the entire book. |
| <i class="fa fa-github"></i> | Opens a link to the website that hosts the source code of the book. |
| <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> | Opens a page to directly edit the source of the page you are currently reading. |

Tapping the menu bar will scroll the page to the top.

### Search

Each book has a built-in search system.
Pressing the search icon (<i class="fa fa-search"></i>) in the menu bar, or pressing the `S` key on the keyboard will open an input box for entering search terms.
Typing some terms will show matching chapters and sections in real time.

Clicking any of the results will jump to that section.
The up and down arrow keys can be used to navigate the results, and enter will open the highlighted section.

After loading a search result, the matching search terms will be highlighted in the text.
Clicking a highlighted word or pressing the `Esc` key will remove the highlighting.

You have the ability to change the theme of the mdBook by clicking the  icon on the top left mdBook. Additionally, there is a toggle for the table of content, and a search tool.

## Printing

Currently the mdBook is approximately 60+ pages, and the environmental impact per page ~10.2L water, 2g CO\\(_2\\) and 2g wood. Therefore, ~600L water, 120g CO\\(_2\\) and 120g wood would be needed to produce a paper copy of this mdBook.

The environmental effects of paper production include deforestation, the use of enormous amounts of energy and water as well as air pollution and waste problems. Paper accounts for around 26% of total waste at landfills

Therefore, please print only if this is really necessary.
