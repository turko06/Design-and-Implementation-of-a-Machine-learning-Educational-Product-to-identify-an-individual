# Iris Recognition
## **Introduction**
Iris recognition is one of the most accurate and reliable biometric identification techniques. It leverages the unique patterns in a person‚Äôs iris‚Äîsuch as crypts, furrows, and collarette‚Äîto verify identity. Unlike traditional biometric methods, modern iris recognition systems use **deep learning and neural networks** to achieve high accuracy, robustness, and adaptability in real-world applications.

This section provides a **comprehensive guide** to designing and implementing a machine learning-based iris recognition system, focusing on **non-conventional methods** for security purposes.

## **Step 1: Iris Image Acquisition**
### **1.1 Importance of High-Quality Iris Images**
The quality of iris images directly impacts the performance of the recognition system. High-quality images ensure accurate feature extraction and matching.

### **1.2 Data Collection Methods**
#### **Datasets for Training**
- **CASIA-IrisV4:** Contains over 50,000 iris images from 700 subjects, captured under controlled conditions.
- **UBIRIS:** Focuses on noisy and less constrained environments, making it suitable for real-world applications.
- **ND-Iris-Template-Ageing Dataset:** Captures iris patterns over time, useful for studying aging effects.

#### **Live Image Capture**
1. **Infrared (IR) Cameras:** Use near-infrared (NIR) light to capture detailed iris textures, even in low-light conditions.
2. **High-Resolution Cameras:** Ensure fine details of the iris are captured.
3. **Preprocessing During Capture:** Remove reflections, noise, and occlusions (e.g., eyelids, eyelashes).

### **1.3 Challenges in Iris Image Acquisition**
- **Reflections and Glare:** Caused by external light sources.
  - **Solution:** Use NIR cameras and polarizing filters.
- **Motion Blur:** Occurs when the subject moves during capture.
  - **Solution:** Use high-speed cameras and stabilize the subject‚Äôs head.
- **Occlusions:** Eyelids and eyelashes can block parts of the iris.
  - **Solution:** Use multiple images and select the one with the least occlusion.

## **Step 2: Iris Image Preprocessing**
Preprocessing is essential to enhance image quality and prepare it for feature extraction.

### **2.1 Preprocessing Techniques**
1. **Grayscale Conversion:** Converts the image to a single channel for easier processing.
2. **Noise Reduction:** Removes noise and reflections using Gaussian blur or median filtering.
3. **Segmentation & Localization:** Isolates the iris region by detecting the inner and outer boundaries (pupil and limbus).
4. **Normalization:** Transforms the iris region into a fixed-size rectangular format using the **Rubber Sheet Model**.

### **2.2 Implementation Example (Python + OpenCV)**
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load iris image
image = cv2.imread('iris.jpg', 0)  # Load in grayscale

# Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
image_blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)

# Use Hough Circle Transform to detect iris boundaries
circles = cv2.HoughCircles(image_blur, cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT, dp=1, minDist=50,
                           param1=50, param2=30, minRadius=30, maxRadius=100)

# Draw detected circles (for visualization)
if circles is not None:
    circles = np.uint16(np.around(circles))
    for circle in circles[0, :]:
        center = (circle[0], circle[1])
        radius = circle[2]
        cv2.circle(image, center, radius, (255, 0, 0), 2)  # Draw outer boundary
        cv2.circle(image, center, 2, (0, 255, 0), 3)       # Draw center

# Display preprocessed iris image
cv2.imshow('Preprocessed Iris', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```



## Step 3: Feature Extraction Using Deep Learning

Traditional methods like Gabor filters are effective, but deep learning-based approaches offer superior performance for complex patterns.

### Deep Learning Feature Extraction Techniques

1. **CNN-Based Feature Extraction:** Uses convolutional layers to capture high-level features from the iris.
2. **Autoencoders for Feature Representation:** Compresses iris features into a smaller latent space for efficient matching.
3. **Wavelet Transform + CNN:** Extracts multi-scale iris features.

### CNN-Based Feature Extraction Implementation (TensorFlow + Keras)

```python

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define CNN model for iris feature extraction
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 100, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),  # Feature vector of size 32
])

model.summary()
```

## Step 4: Model Training & Classification

After extracting features, we train a model to classify iris images and identify individuals.

### 4.1 Classification Models for Iris Recognition

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** End-to-end learning approach for extracting and matching iris features.
2. **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Works well for high-dimensional iris feature vectors.
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) + CNNs:** Captures temporal iris variations over time.

### 4.2 Training a CNN Classifier with TensorFlow

```python
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.losses import SparseCategoricalCrossentropy

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
              loss=SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
history = model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=20, validation_data=(test_data, test_labels))

```

## Step 5: Iris Recognition & Matching

To recognize individuals, the system compares extracted iris features with stored templates in a database.

### 5.1 Iris Matching Techniques

1. **Cosine Similarity:** Measures how similar two iris feature vectors are.
2. **Euclidean Distance:** Computes the distance between two feature embeddings.
3. **Triplet Loss in Deep Learning:** Optimizes recognition by maximizing differences between different irises.

### 5.2 Example: Matching Iris Features with Cosine Similarity

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Compute similarity between two iris feature vectors
similarity_score = cosine_similarity(feature_vector1.reshape(1, -1), feature_vector2.reshape(1, -1))
print(f'Similarity Score: {similarity_score[0][0]}')

```
